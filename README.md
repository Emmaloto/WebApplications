## Create Linked Title Text for URL
Check out what [this app](http://emmaloto.42web.io/lotoapps/urlTitle/) does! I made it because I wanted to copy **YouTube** links to my document files with more information, and Google Docs didn't always give me the helpful popup to replace the linked text with the page title.

#### Things to Fix
- [ ] Better Error checking
- [ ] Visual error representation
- [ ] PHP fails at certain pages
- [ ] PHP grabs title...and then too much!
