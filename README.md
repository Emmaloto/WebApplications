A repo for all my (non-graphic related) web applications.


## ðŸ”— Linked Title Text for URL
Check out what [this app](http://emmaloto.42web.io/lotoapps/urlTitle/) does! I made it because I wanted to copy **YouTube** links to my document files with more information, and Google Docs didn't always give me the helpful popup to replace the linked text with the page title.

#### Things to Fix
- [ ] Better Error checking
- [ ] Visual error representation
- [ ] PHP fails at certain pages
- [ ] PHP grabs title...and then too much!

## ðŸ•“ Multiple Date Formats Table
I wanted to be able to easily copy dates in different formats so that I could do things like append to file names or use as IDs. [This application](http://emmaloto.42web.io/lotoapps/timeFormats/) creates a list of different date formats for easy copying and use.

#### Things to Fix
- [ ] Cleaner date picker
- [ ] Button to copy date value to clipboard
